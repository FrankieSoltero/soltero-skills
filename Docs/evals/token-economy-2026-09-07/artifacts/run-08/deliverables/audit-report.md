# Token-efficiency audit — 2026-09-07

Root: /private/tmp/run-08-home/.claude/projects — 47 transcript files, 47 main-thread sessions with ≥1 assistant turn. Cache TTL assumed 60 min.

## Totals
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Assistant turns | 930 |
| Uncached input (input + cache_creation) | 8,409,400 |
| Cache reads | 656,075,600 |
| Cache hit ratio | 98.7% |
| Output tokens | 610,000 |
| Uncached input per turn | 9,042 |
| Input-equivalent tokens (weights 1/1.25/0.1) | 75,866,560 |

## Levers, ranked by uncached input
| # | Lever | Uncached tokens | Share | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | HEADLESS_SESSIONS | 4,272,000 | 50.8% | 40 sessions with a non-interactive entrypoint (sdk-py: 40); models: claude-opus-4-7: 40; first prompt: "Review this change for security vulnerabilities. Changed files (you may Read these and any other file in the repo): -" |
| 2 | CACHE_TTL_BREAKS | 998,260 | 11.9% | 1 gaps longer than 60 min inside a session; each re-wrote the whole context cold on return |
| 3 | COMPACTIONS | 300,160 | 3.6% | 2 compaction events in 1 sessions; the turn after each rebuilt context from a lossy summary |
| 4 | UNPINNED_DISPATCHES | n/a (not costed here) | — | 18 of 30 Agent dispatches carry no model (they inherit the orchestrator's tier); subagent spend is billed in the subagent transcript, not here |
| 5 | WHOLE_FILE_READS | n/a (not costed here) | — | 151 whole-file Read calls vs 0 ranged; 666,000 bytes of Read results and 111,300 bytes of Bash output landed in the main context |

- **HEADLESS_SESSIONS** — Find the hook or plugin that spawns them and decide whether every firing is worth a cold-context model call; pin it to a cheaper tier or fire it less often.
- **CACHE_TTL_BREAKS** — Before stepping away for longer than the cache TTL, refresh HANDOFF.md and /clear; resume from the handoff instead of re-priming the full context.
- **COMPACTIONS** — Replace compaction with handoff + /clear (agent-handoff at the ~40% reminder).
- **UNPINNED_DISPATCHES** — Pin every dispatch: opus for engineering, sonnet for grunt work, haiku for reading; never inherit.
- **WHOLE_FILE_READS** — Workers read, the orchestrator decides: ranged reads (sed -n, head, grep) in the main thread; a haiku reader for anything long.

## By main model

## Long sessions vs short sessions
| Bucket | Sessions | Uncached/turn | Cache read/turn | Hit ratio | TTL breaks | Handoff sessions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| peak ctx ≥ 200K | 2 | 7,190 | 1,143,937 | 99.4% | 1 | 1 |
| peak ctx < 200K, ≥10 turns | 5 | 3,050 | 28,500 | 90.3% | 0 | 0 |
